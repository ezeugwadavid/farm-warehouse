## Technologies

ES6: See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) for details.

Babel: Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.  see [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) for details.

React: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. see [here](https://reactjs.org/)

SCSS: CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass has features that donâ€™t exist in CSS yet like nesting, mixins, inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write robust, maintainable CSS. see [here](https://sass-lang.com/guide/)
